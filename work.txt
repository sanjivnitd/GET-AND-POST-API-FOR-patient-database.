1. INSTALLING AND CUSTOMIZING SPRING BOOT IDE (STS).
   
   The first challange i faced was in istallation . as my java home path was not properly configured.
   after that i had some issues in customization of spring boot. which i solved myself. 

2. FIRSTLY HAD TO TAKE THE IDEA OF SPRING
    
	 As a beginer i first learned about spring . then i learned some new words and technologies like 
	 what is DEPENDENCY , MAVEN , SERVELET , JSON , XML AND AOP. and several other terms to have a clear understanding of background.
	 then i took overview of structure of classes in springboot.
   
3. MADE HARD CODED DATA BASE TO TEST
   
    As i was very new to spring boot . i first hand did not went for linking data base coz it would had been 
	too complex. so i made a hardcoded small database. and made POST and GET api's for that hardcoded 
	database. I had to download and use POSTMAN for posting data in my hardcoded database.
	then i learned a lot of annotations which were being used in my program and what were the uses of them.

4. USING SQL DATABASE WITH MY PREVIOUSLY MADE CODE
   
   Then i had to learn how to add database in my classes i had made. after i added databases i got some errors 
   that were quite a hectic work for me to resolve.
